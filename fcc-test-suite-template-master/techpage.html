            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), 
            JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
           </p>
           <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, 
            and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. 
            Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;

                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. 
                    The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. 
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow 
                    constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, 
                    JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, 
                    Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common 
                    class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, 
                    what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions 
                    without any special declarative requirements. 
                    Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods

          <p>
            HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the basic scripting language used by web browsers to render pages on the world wide web.
        </p>
        <p>
            HyperText allows a user to click a link and be redirected to a new page referenced by that link

           <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a 
            document written in a markup language such as HTML

            There are many ways to include CSS in a web application, and correspondingly there are many ways to include CSS in Storybook.

            PHP is a general-purpose scripting for the scripting of web developments.
            It was originally produced in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf, a Danish Canadian
            programmer.            
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the major benefits of PHP is that it is platform independent, meaning it can be used on Mac OS, Windows, 
            Linux and supports most web browsers.
